In one sense, any variable in C is just a convenient label for a chunk of the  computer’s
memory that contains the variable’s data. A pointer, then, is a special kind of variable that
contains the location or address of that chunk of memory.  (Pointers are so called because
they point to a chunk of memory.) The address contained by a pointer is a lengthy number
that enables you to pinpoint exactly where in the computer’s memory the variable resides.
